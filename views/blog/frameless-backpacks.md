A frameless backpack is a core element of any ultralightweight backpacking strategy. Since the beginning of the 2000s, they’ve been my backpack model of choice for the majority of hiking trips that I’ve done. The following article contains a rundown of why you should consider using a frameless backpack, addresses some of the most frequently asked questions on the subject, and finally provides a list of 15 highly regarded frameless models, including specs, prices, and links for detailed long-term reviews.

## Why Choose a Frameless Backpack?

### 1. Simplicity

Frameless packs generally have simpler designs. Fewer zippers, fewer compartments, fewer straps, no stays – less that can break, rip, or go wrong.

### 2. Fit

With frameless backpacks, it’s the load itself that provides the structure. With an unrolled or folded sleeping mat acting as a makeshift framesheet, ideally, a frameless pack should mold to the contours of your back.

A moderate or heavy load packed indiscriminately into a frameless model, will be a lot more uncomfortable than it would be in a more forgiving internal or external frame backpack.

### 3. Weight and durability

Because of their simpler design and lack of framesheet or stays, frameless packs are lighter than other models. Generally speaking, they tip the scales at 0.6 kg (21 oz) or less. That said, over the years I have found that the weight saving doesn’t come at the cost of durability.

### 4. Size

People who buy backpacks with large carrying capacities (e.g. 65L or more) generally find ways to fill them. You have all that space, it would be a shame to see it go to waste, no? An inherent advantage of frameless packs is that they are relatively small. An inherent advantage of frameless packs is that they are relatively small.

### 5. Cost 

Fewer materials and simpler designs mean that frameless models are usually cheaper than their internal and external framed equivalents.
