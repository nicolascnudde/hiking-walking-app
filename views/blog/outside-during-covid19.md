## Let’s commit to social distancing in the outdoors

*We understand not everyone is permitted outside right now, and for those who can’t, our hearts go out to you. For those of us who are fortunate enough to make it outdoors, we all need to commit to social distancing before more of the parks we love are closed for public safety. Please check out the below information from our team of medical advisors on how to responsibly get outside during this time. It’s up to us to take care of each other. Let’s keep the one place we all look to for solace – the great outdoors – safe for all.*

### What is social distancing?

According to Johns Hopkins’ Senior Director of Infection Prevention, Lisa Lockerd Maragakis, M.D., M.P.H., social distancing is deliberately increasing the physical space between people to avoid spreading illness. Staying at least six feet away from other people lessens your chances of catching COVID-19. This also means no congregating, and only being around those in your household. It is of the utmost importance we practice social distancing at all times – including when outdoors.

### My trails and outdoor spaces are so crowded it’s difficult to practice social distancing.

With more downtime, more and more people are heading outdoors these days, making it difficult to responsibly keep 6 feet of separation. The trails are filled with new hikers, runners, and cyclists, so let’s set a positive example of how we can responsibly play outside, even in times like these.  Here are a few ideas on how to avoid traffic on the trail and in nature. 

- If you can, try to head out during off-hours. 
- Stay local, and avoid driving to major recreation areas that are attractions for large groups. 
- Look for less popular trails in your community. Maybe you’ll stumble upon a hidden gem! 
- If the trailhead parking lot is full, the trail likely will be too. Consider finding another route if the lot is overcrowded. 
- Avoid single track trails, as it will be difficult to keep 6 feet separation when passing others. Instead, opt for wide fire roads that can accommodate more people. 
- Look for loop trails over out-and-back trails. Not everyone will necessarily be headed in the same direction but there’s a good chance you’ll encounter less return traffic than on an out-and-back.
- Only venture out with people in your household or by yourself.  
- Over-communicate while on the trail, and announce yourself to others when passing to help maintain at least 6 feet of separation. 
- Be safe, but be kind. Some trail goers may be slower than you. Some may not be as familiar with the trail. Let’s be patient with one another, but help remind our community of the importance of social distancing while outdoors.
